# Essay talking about the importance of community in *A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich*
## What communities are there?
#### (Going down in order of size):
## The Gulag:
### Prisoners:
#### Work Groups
### Guards:
#### Posts
### Management/Admin:
#### Camp Commandant, Volkovoi, etc.

# Interactions within community?
## Shukhov vs Fetiukov : Implied vs Explicit, or Dignity vs Indignity
## 

# What do I want to talk about?
## Main theme: Family vs. Community, and their places in the Gulag.
### In the Gulag, the work squadron is not unlike a family unit. Every member of the squad watches out for each other, in exchange for the same treatment from the other members. They will frequently offer services or help to one another without promise of reward, just for the sake of being helpful.
### The Gulag at large is a community, made up of many work squadrons, the guards, and the prison staff (cooks, janitorial staff, clerks)
## What makes them separate?
## How are they similar?

# Structure of ideas:

## The Gulag is home to a complex community of individuals working with and against each other for their own interests.
## The community at large is comprised of the prisoners, guards, clerks, cooks, and those in charge of the prison.
## Each title effectively denotes its own 'sub-community', but most interesting are the family-like dynamics of the prison work-group.
## In the Gulag, despite oppressive living conditions and constant shuffling of prisoners, surprisingly complex and close-knit communities still develop very much like they do in the outside world.




# Thoughts after writing the essay...
## The prompt really spiraled away from me didn't it? I went through enough iterations and became so fixated on the economy that I feel like I may not have focused enough on community itself, rather a product of community. I feel like the economy can still be considered "Some aspect of community", but it feels a little forced.
## The way in which I structured the essay as I was writing it didn't do me many favors either. My paragraph structure was where it's supposed to be, with Evidence-Insight-Insight going strong, but the actual flow between the paragraphs and individual sentences suffered as a result of it. I'm not super sure how to approach a middle ground between just sitting down and writing it all out and over structuring it like I did here. Maybe write it out physically on paper at some point to force myself to consider flow of ideas?
