# Essay talking about the importance of community in *A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich*
## What communities are there?
#### (Going down in order of size):
## The Gulag:
### Prisoners:
#### Work Groups
### Guards:
#### Posts
### Management/Admin:
#### Camp Commandant, Volkovoi, etc.

# Interactions within community?
## Shukhov vs Fetiukov : Implied vs Explicit, or Dignity vs Indignity
## 

# What do I want to talk about?
## Main theme: Family vs. Community, and their places in the Gulag.
### In the Gulag, the work squadron is not unlike a family unit. Every member of the squad watches out for each other, in exchange for the same treatment from the other members. They will frequently offer services or help to one another without promise of reward, just for the sake of being helpful.
### The Gulag at large is a community, made up of many work squadrons, the guards, and the prison staff (cooks, janitorial staff, clerks)
## What makes them separate?
## How are they similar?

# Structure of ideas:

## The Gulag is home to a complex community of individuals working with and against each other for their own interests.
## The community at large is comprised of the prisoners, guards, clerks, cooks, and those in charge of the prison.
## Each title effectively denotes its own 'sub-community', but most interesting are the family-like dynamics of the prison work-group.
## In the Gulag, despite oppressive living conditions and constant shuffling of prisoners, surprisingly complex and close-knit communities still develop very much like they do in the outside world.
