# This is a repo for an essay I wrote in my Humanities IV class.
## There's a 99.9% chance you don't want to read this, unless you happen to either really like high school essays, or you're a high school teacher who wants to see a student's essay development step by step.

# Seriously, you probably won't care in the slightest about this essay.
## It's pretty standard "I didn't really feel particularly strongly about anything related to the prompt, but I have to write 4-5 paragraphs about it" material.
